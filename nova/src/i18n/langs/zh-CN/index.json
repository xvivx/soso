  "The final index price is then calculated as the weighted average of the marginal mid-prices at each size.

The weights are given by:": "最终指数价格是通过对每个挂单规模的边际中间价进行加权平均计算得出的。权重采用指数分布的概率密度函数，呈单调递减趋势，因此更侧重于接近盘口顶端的价格。权重公式如下：",
  "The first 8 bytes of the hash are converted to an unsigned 64-bit integer using little-endian encoding. This integer is then converted to a uniformly distributed floating point number.

  "The index price methodology has been designed to satisfy two important statistical properties of time series: the Markov and martingale properties. The Markov property refers to the memoryless nature of a stochastic process, which ensures that the conditional probability distribution of future values only depends on the current value. The martingale property implies that the current value of a stochastic process is also the expected value of future values. These two properties make Detrade`s index prices unbiased estimators of future prices, so that users can trade on the changes in value of the underlying cryptocurrencies without having to worry about the microstructure effects of individual exchanges.": "指数价格的计算方法旨在满足时间序列的两个重要统计特性：马尔可夫性和鞅性。马尔可夫性指随机过程的无记忆特性，即未来值的条件概率分布仅依赖于当前值，而与过去历史无关。鞅性意味着随机过程的当前值同时也是未来值的期望值。这两个特性使得 Detrade 的指数价格成为未来价格的无偏估计，从而使用户能够基于加密货币的价值变化进行交易，而无需担心单个交易所的微观结构效应。",

If the end price is greater than the start price, the trader who chooses the UP direction wins. Otherwise, the trader who chooses the DOWN direction wins.": "当倒计时结束后，系统将进入准备结算流程。倒计时结束时（即第一个标记点），系统会记录起始价格；随后，K线运行一段时间后（即第二个标记点），系统记录结束价格。系统会对比结束价格与起始价格。若结束价格高于起始价格，则选择看“涨”（UP）方向的用户获胜；若结束价格低于起始价格，则选择看“跌”（DOWN）方向的交易者获胜。",

  "When traded on a traditional exchange with a central limit order book, large taking orders will generally cross with resting orders beyond the best bid or offer, resulting in an average fill price worse than the top-of-book price. Market makers restrict the amount of liquidity that they're willing to offer at the top-of-book because of the additional risk that large orders represent. Rather than require large orders to be filled at multiple prices, Detrade instead uses a market impact formula to set the closing price for winning trades (losing manually-closed trades are unaffected) to replicate the market impact of large taking orders, but in a more consistent and predictable way. The easiest way to see the exact market impact effects is to use the ROI Calculator found on the futures trading page.": "在采用中心化限价订单簿的传统交易所中，当有大额市价单成交时，通常会穿透当前最优买/卖价，与多个挂单成交，导致平均成交价格劣于最优盘口价格。这是因为做市商在盘口上愿意提供的流动性数量有限，以应对大额订单带来的额外风险。为避免大额订单以多个价格成交的情况，Detrade 平台采用市场冲击公式，为盈利交易设定结算价格（手动平仓导致亏损的交易不受影响），以更稳定且可预测的方式模拟大额市价单对市场的影响。想要直观查看市场冲击对收益的具体影响，您可以前往期货交易页面，使用 ROI 计算器进行测算。",
