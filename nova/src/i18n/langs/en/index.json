  "When traded on a traditional exchange with a central limit order book, large taking orders will generally cross with resting orders beyond the best bid or offer, resulting in an average fill price worse than the top-of-book price. Market makers restrict the amount of liquidity that they're willing to offer at the top-of-book because of the additional risk that large orders represent. Rather than require large orders to be filled at multiple prices, Detrade instead uses a market impact formula to set the closing price for winning trades (losing manually-closed trades are unaffected) to replicate the market impact of large taking orders, but in a more consistent and predictable way. The easiest way to see the exact market impact effects is to use the ROI Calculator found on the futures trading page.": "When traded on a traditional exchange with a central limit order book, large taking orders will generally cross with resting orders beyond the best bid or offer, resulting in an average fill price worse than the top-of-book price.
